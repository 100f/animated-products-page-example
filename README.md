> **_An example of component animations and page transitions on a products catalog using NextJS, Styled Components and Framer Motion._**

## :page_facing_up: Overview
This project was made using NextJS framework for React and my goal with it was to learn about the Static Site Generation resource provided by Vercel, and general animations with Framer Motion lib, which I also never tested.

### Main dependencies used:
- NextJS
- Typescript
- Framer Motion
- Styled Components
- JSON Server
